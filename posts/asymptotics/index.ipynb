    "In my PhD thesis, I compare two methods to perform optimal importance sampling: the Cross-Entropy method (CE) and Efficient Importance Sampling (EIS). There are several criteria that you may want to consider for this comparison, but without going into too much detail [If you're interested, check out the [draft of my thesis on Github.](https://github.com/stefanheyder/dissertation)]{.aside}, in this post, I'll focus on only one aspect: asymptotics, in particular asymptotic relative efficiencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of my thesis, this crops up as both methods are simulation-based. Usually, we have to resort to simulation techniques when analytical computation is too difficult, which is exactly the case here! \n",
    "Both methods actually want to solve an optimization problem in the background, solving for an optimal parameter $\\psi$. Unfortunately, the optimization problems involve quantities that we have no (analytical) access to. We can, however, set up a simulation routine that provides an estimate $\\hat\\psi$ of this optimal parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "But using simulations means that the output of both methods is now random, i.e. we can expect to get different results $\\hat\\psi$ when we repeatedly apply the methods using different RNG seeds. This can be problematic: if there is too much variation the actual $\\hat\\psi$ we obtain could be far away from the optimal $\\psi$ and the performance of the methods suffers. \n",

    "This is where asymptotics come into play. When statisticians talk about asymptotics for estimators, here $\\hat\\psi$, they are usually concerned with two things: _consistency_ and _asymptotic normality_. \n",
