    "After discussing the reason for asymptotics in [asymptotics], I want to elaborate a bit more on both consistency and central limit theorems for estimators. In particular, I want to demonstrate proof techniques for showing that an estimator is consistent. Depending on the estimator at hand, these may apply or not. \n",

    "Let's start with the setup for this post. Consider a parametric family of probability measures $(\\mathbf P_{\\theta})_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}$ on $\\mathbf R^n$ where the set of parameters is $k$-dimensional $\\Theta \\subseteq \\mathbf R^k$. We'll require that the family is identifiable, otherwise consistent estimators cannot exist. Let us call the true parameter $\\theta_0\\in\\mathbf R^{k}$. \n",

    "We start with the approach found in [@Lehmann1998Theory] to prove the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE). Actually, with a few additional assumptions (that are fulfilled for MLEs), we can extend their argument to so-called Z-estimators. Z-estimators are estimators that are defined as zeros of so-called estimating equations. These are functions $f_{N}: (\\mathbf R^{n})^{N} \\times \\mathbf R^{k} \\to \\mathbf R^{l}$ of the observed data $X_1, \\dots, X_N \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d}}{\\sim} \\mathbf P_{\\theta_{0}}$ and parameters $\\theta \\in \\Theta$. If $\\hat \\theta_N$ is an estimator of $\\theta$ defined by [Sometimes we can relax the right-hand side to be only $o_{\\mathbf P}(1)$, but that will not be necessary.]{.aside}\n",
