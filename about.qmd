This is me, Stefan Heyder. I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist for [singularIT](https://www.singular-it.de) and am finishing my PhD degree at Technische Universit√§t Ilmenau.

I will sporadically use this blog to process my thoughts on computational statistics, data science and (new!) project management.
This might include procrastination on my PhD thesis.
