In this document, we describe the estimator we are using which was developed in (Fraser 2007), derive its asymptotic properties, and we give details on its implementation. Furthermore, we validate the estimator on simulated data, demonstrate that estimates on real data lead to plausible results, and perform a sensitivity analysis.

The study period covers the onset of the second wave in both countries, with tightening non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequently a decay (Poland) or plateau and renewed increase (Germany) in reported cases. Thirteen independent teams provided probabilistic real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These were reported for lead times of one to four weeks, with evaluation focused on one- and two-week horizons, which are less affected by changing NPIs. Heterogeneity between forecasts was considerable both in terms of point predictions and forecast spread. Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance, in particular in terms of coverage, but did not clearly dominate single-model predictions.

For this one often considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual. While estimates of this quantity are readily available on the national level, subnational estimates, e.g. on the county level, pose more difficulties since only few incidences occur there. However, as countermeasures to the pandemic are usually enforced on the subnational level, such estimates are of great interest to assess the efficacy of the measures taken, and to guide future policy. We present a novel extension of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level. It can handle low and highly variable case counts on the county level, and may be used to distinguish local outbreaks from more widespread ones. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel estimator by a simulation study and by applying the estimator to German case data.","2021-08-31","2021-09-30 12:30:08","2022-11-28 09:32:41","2021-09-30 12:30:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","/Users/stefan/Zotero/storage/CPB2DAX3/2108.html; /Users/stefan/Zotero/storage/MH57FPID/2108.html; /Users/stefan/Nextcloud/Literatur/Burgard et al_2021_Regional estimates of reproduction numbers with application to COVID-19.pdf; /Users/stefan/Nextcloud/Literatur/Burgard2021Regional.pdf","","own_publication","G.3; Statistics - Methodology; J.3; Statistics - Applications; 92C60 (Primary) 62P10 (Secondary)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group.","2021-01-01","2022-01-21 09:37:05","2022-11-28 09:32:41","2022-01-21 09:37:05","1135-1157","","2","20","","SIAM J.

Based on best practice in                         other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can                         maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are                         combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in                         predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and                         07 March 2022.                                   Methods             We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast                         Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19                         cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to                         four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised                         quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble                         forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the                         equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the                         median) of all individual models’ predictive quantiles. We measured the                         performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS),                         comparing models’ forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We                         retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts,                         including weighted averages based on models’ past predictive                         performance.                                   Results             Over 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32                         countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance                         across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble                         performed better on relative WIS than 84% of participating models’ forecasts                         of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92% of participating models’                         forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon,                         ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting                         cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In                         every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most                         contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently                         outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices                         of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was                         to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of                         methods of weighting component forecast models.                                   Conclusions             Our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual                         models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across                         epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics.                         Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better                         predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also                         highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death                         forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two                         weeks.

This speed is captured by indicators such as the reproduction number, the growth factor, the exponential growth rate, and the doubling time. While these indicators are theoretically equivalent they differ in several key aspects, namely their interpretation, how easily they allow to create forecasts, and in their use as tools to communicate with non-experts. To determine which circumstances call for what indicators we derive the renewal equation and the exponential growth model from first principles, and describe how to estimate the indicators from data. In order to interpret these estimates successfully one has to take the quality of the data as well as uncertainties due to estimation and, even more importantly, model misspecification into account. Finally, we evaluate the indicators as tools for communication, focusing on quantifying the impact of countermeasures, conveying the exponential growth of cases, and the ease of creating forecasts. We recommend to use the reproduction number for the first two tasks and the weekly growth factor, interpreted as compound interest, for forecasting. Furthermore we advocate to communicate exponential growth rates only to experts and discourage the use of doubling times altogether.","2023-10-04","2023-10-21 12:44:57","2024-08-12 15:28:57","2023-10-21 12:44:57","51-66","","","","","","","Medizin, Kultur, Gesellschaft","","","","Springer Fachmedien","Wiesbaden","de","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-40525-0_3","","","","","/unread","Kraemer, Alexander; Medzech, Michael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disagreement between estimates can be substantial and may lead to confusion among decision-makers and the general public. In this work, we compare different estimates of the national-level effective reproductive number of COVID-19 in Germany in 2020 and 2021. We consider the agreement between estimates from the same method but published at different time points (within-method agreement) as well as retrospective agreement across eight different approaches (between-method agreement). Concerning the former, estimates from some methods are very stable over time and hardly subject to revisions, while others display considerable fluctuations. To evaluate between-method agreement, we reproduce the estimates generated by different groups using a variety of statistical approaches, standardizing analytical choices to assess how they contribute to the observed disagreement. These analytical choices include the data source, data pre-processing, assumed generation time distribution, statistical tuning parameters, and various delay distributions. We find that in practice, these auxiliary choices in the estimation of Rt may affect results at least as strongly as the selection of the statistical approach. They should thus be communicated transparently along with the estimates.","2023-11-27","2024-01-04 14:55:35","2024-06-18 14:52:54","2024-06-18 09:54:36","e1011653","","11","19","","PLOS Computational Biology","Why are different estimates of the effective reproductive number so different?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/stefan/Nextcloud/Literatur/Brockhaus2023Why.pdf; /Users/stefan/Zotero/storage/BQCUTN73/Brockhaus2023Whya.pdf","","","Epidemiology; Pandemics; COVID 19; Virus testing; /add_tags; Programming languages; Public and occupational health; Random walk; Statistical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
